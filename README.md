We want people to use [EFUI](https://pub.dev/packages/empathetech_flutter_ui), and what better way than to lead by example?

Here is the Flutter code that we use to build [our site!](https://www.empathetech.net/)

Hopefully this and [Smoke Signal](https://github.com/Empathetech-LLC/smoke_signal) can inspire you to make your own apps with EFUI!

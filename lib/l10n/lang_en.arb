Many projects can also be freely modified and redistributed.\nIt's software with nothing to hide, built by folx who recognize shared problems require shared solutions.\n\nAnd in the wonderful world of open source software, there lies a sub category: self hosting software.\n\nSelf hosting lets us take any not-in-use computer (pocket sized ones too) and store our data there.\nBy self hosting, we can control our own digital presence, rather than sign away control to some far away server, owned by an un-empathetic corporation.\n\nAnd there are self hosted versions of just about everything! From Adobe to Zoom, there are passionate hacktivists building alternatives that put people over profits.\n\nSo, how does one make the switch from profit first/closed source to open source? How do they start self hosting?\nIt takes a lot of time, energy, and prior knowledge.\n\nThat's where we come in.",
